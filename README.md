# Winform-Games
A small collection of games written in C# as WinForm applications using Visual Studio.
The games aren't completely polished and were made very quickly as small challenges to myself so bugs are present!
To test them out download the release folder and run testing.exe. You will need to have the .NET Framework installed on your computer for this to work.
